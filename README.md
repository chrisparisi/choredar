This project was born after a discussion with my roommate on the best way to assign chores that must be done around the house. I used this opportunity to make a Fullstack MERN app with CRUD functionality to show what I know, and learn a few more things along the way.

The backend uses NodeJS and Express to handle routing. The database was built with MongoDB and Mongoose. The frontend was built using ReactJS with Sass for styling. Redux Toolkit was used to handle state. The project was hosted on Heroku.

From a learning perspective, the things I wanted to get the most out of this project was getting more comfortable with Redux, how JWT works, as well as how data flows from database to backend to frontend with Redux.

Things I want to change on this project:

1. I do not like the login flow and how user info is stored in local storage. I want to change it to best practices with cookies and storing in memory instead.
2. Continue making the UI look better and more modern and improve accessibility.
